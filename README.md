# ComposeVR

The goal of this project is to provide a VR interface for Bitwig Studio (or any other DAW which provides an extensive API).
[Here's the code I've written so far](https://github.com/lane-s/ComposeVR/tree/master/Assets/ComposeVR/Scripts)

The project depends on some proprietary shaders and particle effects, so it is not currently possible to build directly from this source code. I plan to replace these shaders and effects with my own code so that the entire project can be open sourced.
